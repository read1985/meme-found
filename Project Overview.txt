Project Overview
This project is a web-based service that monitors the Solana blockchain—specifically focusing on coins launched on Raydium—and alerts users when a new coin meets their custom, user-defined criteria. The primary goal is to empower users to catch potentially lucrative or risky tokens by leveraging real-time blockchain data and advanced filtering based on multiple metrics.

Technical Architecture
--------------------
The application is built as a unified Next.js application deployed on Vercel, leveraging the platform's serverless architecture and edge computing capabilities.

Frontend:
- Next.js 13+ with App Router
- React with TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Server and Client Components
- Optimized with Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)

Backend:
- Next.js API Routes (serverless functions)
- Edge Functions for performance-critical operations
- Vercel Postgres or similar serverless-compatible database
- WebSocket support for real-time updates

Key Features
-----------
